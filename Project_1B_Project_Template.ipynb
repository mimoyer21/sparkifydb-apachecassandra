    "## Project Background: \n",
    "A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your role is to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions, and wish to bring you on the project. You'll be given questions that the analytics team needs to answer and will be able to test your database by writing queries to answer those questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Overview:\n",
    "This script creates an Apache Cassandra database named 'project_1b', creates table that match how we want to model our Sparkify user behavior data, and processes the raw CSV data files to insert the data into our database tables.\n"
